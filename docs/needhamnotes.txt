speech bubbles 888888888888888888888888888888888888888888

OK, so here are our 4 Final Fantasy -- I mean --
unique Hero Glyphix style speech bubbles.

bubble1 - Standard
bubble2 - Quiet / Scared
bubble3 - Loud / Angry
bubble4 - Thinking

As you can see they all have the same feel as the one
you've seen before, on the old gameplay screen mockup.
I've made some progress on the friendly white font
that will be used on these but it's not ready for you
quite yet. 

The idea behind using one font exclusively on this
type of blue background is that we can get really
smooth edges on the letters, as opposed to OTT's fonts
which had to work on a wider variety of background.
Aside from the bubbles, this white font is planned to
be used when a Rank-Up or other important message pops
up on the gameplay screen: for that, I'll make a
similar blue window graphic, but with a gold border.
Another example would be on the Save screen: the
information relating to the Save positions (Journey
name, time elapsed) will go in a similar blue box. I
think this consistency will be attractive.

If you feel like putting the bubbles into the game
soon (and using the temporary font for the dialogue)
then please place them at 189,13.

Cheers!,
---Matt

HOURGLASS88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888



Hi,

glad you liked the hourglass idea, here are the two
files you need to get it working. 

I've shifted down to 256 color graphics and we've lost
a little subtlety in the soft metallic tones, but it's
barely noticeable. And wow, it zips to a mere 12K !


sflow.bmp
---------

These are the frames for the first sprite. They
contain the body of the hourglass & the falling sand.
Size of each frame = 61x93.

1-6:  Starting animation
7-9:  The 3 falling sand frames which are played
repeatedly
10-13:  The ending animation
14:  The hourglass with a full top bulb (displayed
before a puzzle begins)


As the puzzle begins you'll want to play those first
six frames and then play 7,8,9,7,8,9 etc. until time
runs out. When the time hits zero play frames 10-13
and the last few grains will land in the bottom bulb.



slevel.bmp
----------

The eleven different levels of sand for the top
sprite. Size of each frame = 35x54.

You can control the frame number by the kind of
function I mentionned in my last post. This sprite
should become active the instant the puzzle begins,
and be removed the instant it stops. Very simple.


~~~~


Positions on screen:
---------------------------

The main hourglass sprite goes at 701, 199.
The sand level sprite goes on top of it at 714, 220.


Hope that's all clear. I should have the 4 speech
bubbles ready soon, and don't worry about an HG update
- I have plenty to work on. :)

The charges are 16x19, and should be placed on the
gameplay screen at:

1) 124,212
2) 136,227
3) 124,242

Hi,

here are the 2-state buttons for Skimlet's gameplay
screen.

b-quit:  Quit Button  (Size: 80x43 , Place on GP
screen @ 294,545)

b-pause:  Pause/Map Button  (Size: 160x43, Place on GP
screen @ 381,545)

b-book:  The Reveal Spellbook  (Size: 80x85, Place on
GP screen @ 35,203)


Also, the file "charges2.bmp" has four frames that you
can use to represent how many spell charges the player
has; 0,1, 2 and 3 in order. (The #2 in the name refers
to "Skimlet's Journey" being the 2nd journey) The size
of each frame is 28x49 and they should be placed on
the screen @ 124,212.

Hey,

I didn't want to send you the Speech Bubble font until
I'd played around with it thoroughly. I've run some
pre-tests to the exact specifications of the font, a
couple of which I've included along with the font
file. I'm pleased with the result; it seems friendly,
very readable and small enough to fit plenty of
dialogue onto a single bubble 'page'. A second opinion
would be welcome though!

I've laid out the font file (bfont) in a new format so
that it's extremely easy for you to check positions
and keep track of any changes. The letters are all
consecutive in their rows with no unneccessary spaces,
but between the rows I've drawn separating areas with
markers showing the beginning of the letter beneath.

With luck you won't even have to make reference to
that however, because here are all the positions you
should need (the letters are all 18 pixels tall):

Row 1 (Y=4): Capital letters.  X=:

A - 4     (width=11)
B - 15     (width=10)
C - 25     (width=10)
D - 35     (width=11)

X - 241     (width=13)
Y - 252     (width=11)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage:
--------

The speech bubbles themselves should be placed on the
screen at 189,13.

Each bubble can accomodate up to 4 lines of text. When
you first implement the bubble dialogue in the game,
you may want to just start near the top of the bubble
regardless of how many lines of text need to be
displayed. Eventually though, it would be great for
the presentation if you could write a function to work
out how many lines a string of text requires to be
displayed; and then to display it at a corresponding
height. Using something like the following figures
will centre the dialogue nicely in the bubble:

4 lines:  Starting height= 42
3 lines: Starting height=52
2 lines: Starting height= 62
1 line: Starting height= 72

There should be a 4 pixel gap between lines of text.

A line of text begins at X=248 and should extend no
further than X=568.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If any of that isn't clear then let me know and I'll
put some graphics together to illustrate it better.

Have a good weekend!,
---Matt :)

Here are all the art files I think you need for the
Library level. Please use the same Quit and Pause/Map
buttons as Skimlet's Journey.

hg-mouse:
----------

All the mouse pointers in one file. Each mouse graphic
is 45x45 and its hot spot is at 11,3. There are four
rows here, each containing seven frames for one type
of pointer.

The first row can hold system pointers, for the menus.
I've quickly made an enlarged marble version of the
Windows arrow, plus six more frames with a timer that
could be cycled through if the game is loading or
saving. The frames on this row could hold entirely
different types of system pointers though.

The other three rows have pointers that are accessible
during the game. Row 2 is the quill, row 3 is the
regular wand, and row 4 will be the wand's ebony form
when evil old Edizon is using it.


Horizontal and vertical bars:
------------------------------

Just the updated 5x5 and 8x8 puzzle versions, because
that's all Glyphix 101 needs.


cluedigits1 and cluedigits2:
----------------------------

These are the clue graphics for Journey 1 and Journey
2. Please let me know if you'd prefer them to be held
in a single file and I'll reformat them for you.


Spell book:
-----------

Spbook1 is the spellbook button for Journey 1.


Special marks:
--------------

Libmark5 and libmark8 are the two sizes of the
system-only mark for the library. I've sent them as
these two separate files, but if you let me know how
you'd like to organise them I'll do that for you.


Reveal charges:
-----------

Charges.bmp updated to include a library version.

Hi,

I've made a long speech bubble graphic that you can
use behind all the hint text that pops up. The longest
hint message appears to be the one about the Pause
button, so it's designed to fit text up to that size.
I can easily make longer or shorter variants if you
want them.

Also, I've given our text advance arrow a proper,
smooth little animation. The frames are still in
textadvance.bmp, but they're now just 17x17. They need
to be placed at +376 x +105 relative to the speech
bubble's position. 

Please run the animation in a sweeping loop, ie. 1, 2,
3, 4, 3, 2 and repeat. ta.gif is animated to show it
working.

If it's easier to have this stored as if they were six
different frames (so that you can just increment the
frame number up to six, then repeat) let me know and
I'll do that.
